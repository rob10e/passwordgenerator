# All Password Generator

This is an off-line password generation application. This program features various password generation algorithms. The goal of this program is to provide a collection of different methods of generating passwords while providing feedback to the user as to the strength of the generated password. This program will be updated continuously as more algorthims are included.

Many algorithms will be the product of information / examples found on the internet. When possible, I will attempt to provide references as well as credit to the authors of these algorithms. If you suspect that I have included an algorithm without giving you credit, or feel my inclusion of an algorithm violates and rights, please notify me. It is not my intention to take credit for your work.
